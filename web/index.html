			<p> So you want to write an email but you're not sure how to start. No need to worry you've come to the right place because on this page you will find a simple step by step guide on how to write an email.</p>

		<h2 id="step1"> Step 1: Who are you emailing and the subject of the email</h2>
			<ul>When you first begin writing your email there are two very important pieces of information you need to start with the first is the email address of the person you are emailing and the subject of the email. Be sure to write the correct email address in the box that says "to" of the person you are writing to otherwise they will not respond to the email. 
			<p> Next is the email subject. This step is very important as it lets the person reading your email know what the email is about with out having to read it. This way the person knows to read it right away if it is urgent or can look for the email much easier in their in box.</p>
			<p> Make the subject of your email short and to the point. You do not need to explain everything you are writing about(that's what the body of you email is for) but give them enough information so they know what to expect. </p>
